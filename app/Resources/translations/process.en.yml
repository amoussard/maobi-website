  1:
    title: Analysis
    description: 'A discovery period that enables us to better understand your project’s essence and to identify your users’ needs for your products or services. We shall develop on your initial ideas and look for inspiration to propose a few action plans.'
  2:
    title: Strategy
    description: "At this stage, we shall take a closer look at alternatives identified during the analysis period. By now, a coherent direction will be chosen. This stage organises the project’s elements by order of importance. To do so, we use storymapping: a technique defining targeted users’ online behaviour. Thus, the value of the website’s different functionalities is clarified, facilitating the distinction between essential functionalities and \_\"added value\" functionalities. Knowing which functionalities to deliver consequently enables a quick and maximal valorisation of the final product."
